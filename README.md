# [Statistical analysis: 3 point shooting](https://github.com/radarreed/Drafting_3_point_shooters/blob/main/three_pt_analysis.ipynb)
* Assesses the relationship between NBA player's 3 point shooting ability before and after entering the NBA
* Uses a paired t-test and a 95% confidence interval to validate the difference in mean values.
* Uses multiple linear regression to determine which statistics are most likely to signal a future successful NBA shooter.
* Aggregates and merges the data tables produced from the Web Scraping from Basketball-Reference.com project

# [Automating excel with Openpyxl](https://github.com/radarreed/Automate_excel_with_openpyxl/blob/main/reports.ipynb)
* Mass produces custom spreadsheets (formulas, formatting, graphs, everything!)
* Can connect to any data source 
* Doesn't skip date ranges with no activity in the period by adding missing indexes
* See the resulting excel file in the respository folder for this project

# [Web Scraping from Basketball-Reference.com](https://github.com/radarreed/Basketball-reference.com_web_scraper/blob/main/nbascrape-iter.ipynb)
* Gathers hundreds of thousands of NBA and pre-NBA game stats for players drafted into the NBA
* Used for a database for future statistical analysis projects
* Parses html source code using the python package, Beautiful Soup
* I made the resulting datasets publicly available at https://www.kaggle.com/reedthomas/nba-intl-and-ncaa-game-logs-for-20032020-drafts
